# Evaluation application

This app is for me to evaluate students

https://eval-me.herokuapp.com

People have to be white listed to be able to signup
a demonstration account is setup :

  test@test.com
  password

In backoffice there is many feature such as :
  - creation of evaluations with some ajax here and there
  - possibility to mark evaluations as "viewable"
  - exportation of results in pdf
  - richtext edition for questions in order to make them more readable
  .....

[TODO]:
  - image in questions

  - csv importation of whitelisted account

  - polymorphism on answertype (text , radios , selections etcect)

  - mechanisation of correction

  - csf export of results
